# GBDK

fortISSimO is written with GBDK compatibility in mind.
Unfortunately, no current version of `rgb2sdas` is able to handle the conversions required by fO, although it is known to be feasible.

Two solutions are possible:
- The GBDK team switches to using RGBLINK as a back-end, to enable mixing RGBASM and SDAS object files in a single project.
- Someone upgrades `rgb2sdas` or writes their own conversion script that can handle the necessary conversions.

If you are interested in helping with either solution, please contact me.
